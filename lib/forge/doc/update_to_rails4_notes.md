* had to run 'bundle update' to get everything cleared out

High Priority To-Do:

* I haven't run any of the tests yet, so that may be a big ugly surprise too!

Notes:

* use the local version of Forge to create new Forge sites - from the root folder, run:
  be bin/forge new NAME_OF_APP MODULE_LIST
  e.g:
  be bin/forge new testapp events,ecommerce
  be bin/forge new testapp banners,dispatches,ecommerce,events,galleries,posts,subscribers,videos
